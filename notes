Database Schema:

    Blockchain Table:

    Purpose: Store metadata about each blockchain.
    Columns:
        ID: A unique identifier for each blockchain. This is incremented and does not
            correspond to the notion of chain ID's present in EVM chains.
        Chain_Name: The name of the blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, zkSync Era, etc.).
        Chain_Slug: The cleaned name of the blockchain (e.g., ethereum, zksync_era, etc.).


    Block Table:

    Purpose: Store data for each block.
    Columns:
        ID: A unique identifier for each block.
        Chain_ID: A unique identifier for each blockchain. This is incremented and does
            not correspond to the notion of chain ID's present in EVM chains.
        Block_Number: The block number.
        Parent_Hash: Hash of the parent block.
        Block_Timestamp: Time the block was mined.
        Transaction_Count: Number of transactions in the block.


    TPS Tables:

    Purpose: Store time-series tps data for each blockchain.
    Columns:
        ID: A unique identifier for each chain and timestamp.
        Chain_ID: A unique identifier for each blockchain. This is incremented and does
            not correspond to the notion of chain ID's present in EVM chains.
        Block_Timestamp: Time the block was mined.
        TPS_Min: Minimum TPS over the given interval.
        TPS_Avg: Average TPS over the given interval.
        TPS_Max: Maximum TPS over the given interval.
